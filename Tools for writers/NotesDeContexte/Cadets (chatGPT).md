During the Russian Revolution, naval cadets played a significant role in various aspects of the conflict. The role of naval cadets differed depending on their allegiance and the specific stage of the revolution. Here are some key aspects of their involvement:

1. Support for the Provisional Government: Following the February Revolution of 1917, which led to the abdication of Tsar Nicholas II, the Provisional Government was established. Naval cadets often supported this new government and its policies. They were involved in maintaining order, guarding key installations, and assisting in the transition to a new political order.
    
2. Participation in the Kornilov Affair: In August 1917, General Lavr Kornilov attempted to stage a coup against the Provisional Government. Many naval cadets, along with their instructors and officers, were sympathetic to Kornilov's cause. They joined the ranks of the counter-revolutionary forces in defense of the existing order. However, the coup ultimately failed.
    
3. Involvement in the October Revolution: During the October Revolution of 1917, naval cadets were divided in their loyalties. Some supported the Bolsheviks, while others remained loyal to the Provisional Government or sided with other anti-Bolshevik factions. Naval cadets played a role in the defense of key naval bases and were involved in clashes with various revolutionary groups.
    
4. Formation of the Red Navy: After the Bolsheviks seized power, they established the Red Navy as part of their efforts to consolidate control. Many naval cadets joined the newly formed Red Navy, bringing their training and expertise to the revolutionary cause. They played a crucial role in the organization, operation, and expansion of the Red Navy during the Russian Civil War.
    
5. Opposition from White Army and Allies: The White Army, composed of anti-Bolshevik forces, including some former naval officers and cadets, actively fought against the Bolsheviks. Naval cadets who remained loyal to the Provisional Government or were opposed to the Bolshevik regime joined the ranks of the White Army. Some cadets also received support from foreign powers, such as the Allied intervention forces, during the Russian Civil War.
    

It's important to note that the involvement of naval cadets during the Russian Revolution varied significantly depending on their personal beliefs, regional circumstances, and the evolving political landscape.
